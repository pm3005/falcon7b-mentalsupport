# falcon7b-mentalsupport
This project showcases the fine tuning of the Falcon 7B parameter model using QLoRA allowing for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that requires significantly less memory than traditional methods. This approach enables training large language models on consumer-grade hardware like the free tier of Google Colab while maintaining performance quality.
This model focuses on the mental health of a person. 
The resulting chatbot can serve as an accessible first point of contact for individuals seeking mental health support, particularly in situations where professional help might be delayed or unavailable
